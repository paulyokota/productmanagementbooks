			The book is structured into four sections: Evaluate your product, When to say no to new features, Which new features to build, and Getting that feature used. Industry luminaries like Hunter Walk, Dharmesh Shah and Ryan Singer have praised it for its value for anyone who is either working in or interested in a product role. Best of all, they're giving it away for free.
