			Author Eric Ries took the lessons he learned developing his startup IMVU along with Steve Blank's teachings on customer development and the Lean Manufacturing philosophy deveoloped at Toyota, and synthesized them into a model of how companies can learn and iterate to achieve rapid, efficient growth. The Lean Startup methodology has since been adopted by thousands of organizations, spreading far beyond the tech and startup community to allow anyone to benefit from the build-measure-learn cycle of innovation. A foundational text for anyone interested in the field of product management.
